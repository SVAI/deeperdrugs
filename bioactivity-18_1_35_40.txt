All kinase assays were performed in 96-well FlashPlates from Perkin Elmer/NEN (Boston, Mass., USA) in a 50 µl reaction volume. The reaction mixture was pipetted in four steps in the following order:20 µl of assay buffer (standard buffer),5 µl of ATP solution (in H2O),5 µl of test compound (in 10% DMSO),10 µl of substrate/10 µl of enzyme solution (premixed),The assay for all enzymes contained 60 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 3 µM Na-Orthovanadate, 1.2 mM DTT, 50 µg/ml PEG20000, 1 µM [-33P]-ATP (approx. 5×1005 cpm per well).	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	11626	CHEMBL3116	SINGLE PROTEIN	P50750	Cyclin-dependent kinase 9	Homo sapiens	9	Protein	Pkinase	high	94363	CHEMBL3638952			2014
